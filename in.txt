Tell me you are mine. I"ll be yours through all the years, till the end of time. Love is a fire which burns unseen. I feel happy at times we have had angry words but these have been kissed away. You cannot appreciate happiness unless you have known sadness too. But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, all losses are restored, and sorrows end.
